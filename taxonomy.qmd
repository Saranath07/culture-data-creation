# **Taxonomy for Collecting Indian Cultural Data Using LLMs and Graph-Based Approaches**

This taxonomy organizes the methods and frameworks for collecting, curating, and analyzing cultural data from Indian subcultures using a combination of **graph-based techniques** and **language models**.

#### **1. Data Sources**
   - **Community-Generated Data**:  
     Data sourced directly from communities through participatory research, surveys, interviews, or gamified frameworks (e.g., DOSA paper).
   - **Web Data**:  
     Crawling cultural information from structured (Wikipedia, government websites) or unstructured (blogs, forums) online sources.
   - **Historical and Literary Texts**:  
     Analyzing books, epics, religious texts, and manuscripts for cultural references.
   - **Social Media Data**:  
     Extracting discussions from platforms like Twitter, YouTube, or Instagram, especially focusing on hyperlocal trends and dialogues.
   - **Multilingual Resources**:  
     Incorporating linguistic diversity by collecting data in multiple Indian languages and dialects, including code-mixed language from social media.

#### **2. Types of Cultural Data**
   - **Social Artifacts**:  
     Physical or conceptual artifacts that represent cultural identity (e.g., food, festivals, clothing, traditions).
   - **Local Practices and Rituals**:  
     Documentation of rituals, festivals, and practices specific to regions or subcultures.
   - **Hyperlocal Landmarks**:  
     Cultural landmarks like temples, monuments, and local historical sites (e.g., using LOFTI's localization approach).
   - **Language and Dialects**:  
     Regional languages, dialects, and code-mixing in communication (e.g., the multilingual focus from Beyond Metrics paper).
   - **Storytelling and Oral Traditions**:  
     Folk tales, oral histories, and narratives passed through generations.

#### **3. Granularity Levels**
   - **National Level**:  
     Broad, pan-Indian cultural elements that are widely known across the country (e.g., festivals like Diwali, Holi).
   - **State/Regional Level**:  
     Specific to a particular state or region (e.g., Pongal in Tamil Nadu, Bihu in Assam).
   - **Hyperlocal (City/Town)**:  
     Culture that is deeply rooted in specific towns or cities, including dialects, local legends, and smaller festivals.
   - **Diaspora Level**:  
     Cultural practices adapted by the Indian diaspora globally, which may differ from the homeland practices.

#### **4. Data Representation Methods**
   - **Entity-Relationship Graphs**:  
     Capturing relationships between cultural entities (e.g., relationships between a festival, region, and associated rituals).
   - **Hierarchical Graphs**:  
     Organizing data in a tree-like structure from broader cultural categories to specific artifacts (e.g., "Indian Festivals" -> "South Indian" -> "Pongal").
   - **Social Network Graphs**:  
     Mapping social and cultural relationships between people, practices, and artifacts to understand cultural influence and spread.
   - **Temporal Graphs**:  
     Tracking changes in cultural practices and artifacts over time (e.g., how a festival's rituals have evolved).

#### **5. Engagement Techniques**
   - **Gamification**:  
     Involving participants in data collection through games (as seen in DOSA). Examples include clue-based guessing games or scavenger hunts for cultural artifacts.
   - **Crowdsourcing Platforms**:  
     Using platforms like Karya to engage communities in contributing their cultural knowledge.
   - **Collaborative Annotation**:  
     Encouraging people from different regions to contribute annotations, descriptions, and meanings for local cultural data.
   - **Feedback Loops with Communities**:  
     Allowing communities to review and validate the data, ensuring that the cultural artifacts are represented accurately.

#### **6. Evaluation Frameworks**
   - **Cultural Relevance**:  
     Ensuring that the data collected and represented by LLMs accurately reflects cultural knowledge as understood by local communities.
   - **LLM Factuality and Localization**:  
     Evaluating how well LLMs localize global knowledge to an Indian context (e.g., LOFTIâ€™s factuality and hyperlocality metrics).
   - **Bias Mitigation**:  
     Ensuring that LLMs do not propagate Western or urban biases in their understanding of Indian culture.
   - **Multilingual Support**:  
     Evaluating the performance of LLMs across various Indian languages and their ability to handle code-mixed data.

#### **7. Challenges and Solutions**
   - **Geographical Bias**:  
     Mitigating biases toward English-speaking or Westernized urban centers by ensuring representation from rural and underrepresented regions.
   - **Linguistic Diversity**:  
     Accounting for the linguistic complexity of India, where many regions use multiple languages or dialects in communication.
   - **Data Scarcity for Hyperlocal Cultures**:  
     Addressing the lack of easily accessible data for smaller, hyperlocal cultures by using participatory methods or gamification.

#### **8. Applications**
   - **Cultural Preservation**:  
     Building datasets to preserve and document dying traditions, languages, and practices.
   - **Educational Tools**:  
     Using collected data to build educational resources and interactive experiences to teach Indian cultural heritage.
   - **Personalized LLM Responses**:  
     Training LLMs to generate culturally relevant responses in local languages and dialects, tailored to specific regions.
   - **Policy and Cultural Research**:  
     Assisting governments, historians, and researchers in understanding and preserving diverse cultural identities through structured data collection.
